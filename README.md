## ABEAMS Simulation Engine

ABeams is an ambitious project aiming to create a **complex economic and political simulation** engine. It will model intricate interactions within an agent-based framework, providing a dynamic and insightful platform for understanding market and political behaviors.

---

## Frontend Git Repository

You can find the frontend code for ABeams here:
[https://github.com/the0hdDev/abeams-frontend](https://github.com/the0hdDev/beams-frontend)

---

## Development Timeline

We anticipate ABeams will be feature-complete around **December 2025**, with an estimated codebase of **10,000 - 15,000 lines of code**.

---

## Upcoming Features

We're actively working on bringing the following key features to ABeams:

* **Core Simulation Engine:** The heart of ABeams, enabling detailed agent interactions and system evolution.
* **Multithreading Support:** Enhancing performance and scalability for complex simulations.
* **Electron Frontend:** A robust and user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the simulation.
* **REST API:** Providing programmatic access to simulation data and controls.
* **Advanced Economic Models:** Implementing diverse economic theories and scenarios.
* **Political Agent Behaviors:** Simulating political decision-making and its impact on the economy.
* **Data Visualization Tools:** Intuitive graphs and charts to help users analyze simulation outcomes.
* **Scenario Editor:** Allowing users to create and customize their own simulation environments.
* **Modding Support:** Opening up possibilities for community-driven extensions and new features.
